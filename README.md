# data set from the website of Space
# Business Problem:
It will be predicted if the first stages of falcon 9 is usable again or not. so we should be sure if the landing is successful or not. It is important to know the reusibility of stages because the cost of landing of other providers are about 165 million dollar however Space X spends about 62 and defintely it will be useful for new entrance.\n",
    "the data will be collected from API.\n",
    "the problem is classification supervised learning.\n",
